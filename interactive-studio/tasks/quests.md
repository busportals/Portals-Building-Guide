# Quests

You can turn any task into a quest by toggling on the visibility of the task.

Space Options > Tasks > Select the Task > Toggle Visibility on.

## Setup

This will then make the task available for users to see in the quest log. Each task state corresponds to a different display in the quest log.

* Not Active > Not Visible
* Active > Visible but not marked as complete
* Completed > Visible and marked as complete

## Groups

By typing in a group name you are creating a "Quest Group". This will organize all of the tasks with the same group name in the quest log as a "Quest Group". If you do not type in a group name the quests will be grouped under "Other".

## Rewards

You can add item rewards (wearables and other collectibles) to a quest as well. This will give the user the item when the quest hits the completed state. Currently you will need the help of a Portals Team member to implement the items.
