# Non-Persistent Tasks

By default, all tasks are "persistent". This means that the state of the task will persist in between sessions. So if 'Task 1' is in the completed state and you refresh the room it will still be in the completed state.

You can make a task non-persistent by going to space options > tasks > selecting the task > toggle on non-persistent.

Turning on non-persistent task will make it so the task does not stay in the same state upon refresh. So if  a task is in the Completed state and you refresh, it will be Not Active upon reentering the space. This is especially helpful for games that have high repeatability (e.g. Perilous Pipes).
