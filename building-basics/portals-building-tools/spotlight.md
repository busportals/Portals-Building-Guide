# Spotlight

### Overview

The Spot Light tool is a directional, cone-shaped light source. It’s ideal for focused lighting like stage spots, dramatic highlights, or guiding players’ attention to key areas.

### Placement Settings

#### Spot Light Settings Panel

* Choose Custom – Opens the color picker to set the light color
* Brightness – Controls how intense the light appears
* Range – Sets how far the light projects from its origin
* Only Night – If enabled, the light is visible only during night cycles
* Spread – Controls the width of the cone (lower = narrower beam, higher = wider beam)

### Common Use Cases

* Spotlighting interactive objects or NPCs
* Stage lighting for events or performances
* Creating dramatic or directional lighting effects
