# Spawn Point

### Overview

The Spawn Point tool defines where players appear when entering a space or when teleported via a Portal. Each space can have multiple spawn points.

* You can right-click a placed Spawn Point (in build mode) and select Copy Spawn Link to copy the room URL with a ?spawn=yourSpawnName query string, which can be pasted into a Portal item

### Placement Settings

#### Spawn Settings Panel

* Default Spawn – Toggle to make this the default spawn point for the space
* Spawn Name – Optional label for use with Portals. This name is case-sensitive and must match exactly when referenced in a Portal

### Common Use Cases

* Define player entry points for different levels or zones
* Create fast travel destinations in large spaces
