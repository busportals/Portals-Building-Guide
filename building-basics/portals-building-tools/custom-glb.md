# Custom GLB

### Overview

The Custom GLB tool allows you to upload and place any 3D object in your space using the .glb format. This is ideal for adding unique props, decorations, or game assets.

* Max file size: 15MB
* Supports optional Draco compression for optimized models

### Inventory Settings

#### Custom GLB Upload Interface

* Paste Item URL – Use a direct link to a .glb file hosted online
* Enable Draco Compression – Toggle on to enable support for Draco-compressed GLBs
* Spawn GLB – Spawns the object into your space after selection
* Drag & Drop – Upload a local .glb file directly from your device

### Placement Settings

#### GLB Settings Panel

* Collider On – Enable or disable physics collision for the object
* Shadow On – Toggle shadow rendering for the object
* Size – Scale the object up or down (default is 1)
* GLB URL – Displays the hosted URL of the object
* Local Animation – Enable if the GLB has animation and should play locally. If it is off the animation will be synced on the server and you may experience lag (skipping) in the animation if it is large.

* Remove First Frame – Skips the first frame of the animation if needed
* Custom Title – Optional label for organizing or referencing the object
