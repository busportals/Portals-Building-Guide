# Elemental

### Overview

The Elemental tool creates animated surfaces like water or lava using dynamic textures. It is ideal for environmental effects, hazards, or decorative terrain that feels more alive than static build blocks.

* Drag & Drop – Upload a texture file (max size: 1.5MB)
* Browse Files – Upload from your device
* Choose From Presets – Select from built-in textures (lava, water, magma)
* Spawn Elemental – Adds the object to your scene

### Placement Settings

### Elemental Settings Panel

* Shadow – Toggles whether the surface casts a shadow
* Collision – Enables or disables physical interaction with the surface
* Transparency – Controls how transparent the surface appears
* Scale – Adjusts overall size/thickness of the surface

### Common Use Cases
