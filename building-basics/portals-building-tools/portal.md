# Portal

### Overview

The Portal tool teleports players to a defined spawn point in the same space or a different one. It’s activated when a player enters the portal area and is commonly used to connect rooms, levels, or entirely separate games.

* Resize the Portal to fit your needs
* If you paste a full Portals link with a named spawn, the spawn field will auto-fill
* Spawn names are case-sensitive
* Leave the spawn name blank to send users to the default spawn point

### Placement Settings

#### Portal Settings Panel

* Destination – Paste the full space or game URL here
* Spawn Name – Name of the target spawn point (case-sensitive; optional for default)
* Auto Teleport (Toggle) –
  * On – Users teleport instantly upon entering the portal
  * Off – Users must press X to activate teleport
* Custom Message – Sets the action prompt shown to users when Auto Teleport is off.
  * Example: if the message is “teleport,” the player will see “Press X to teleport”

### Common Use Cases

* Link rooms or levels within a larger experience
* Connect to entirely different games or spaces
* Create seamless transitions between worlds or events
