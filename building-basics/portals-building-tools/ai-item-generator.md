# AI Item Generator

### Overview

The AI Item Generator is a new feature that allows users to create 3D objects from 2D images. Simply upload an image of the item you want to convert, and the AI will generate a corresponding 3D model. This tool is ideal for quickly prototyping props, furniture, or simple assets for use in Portals experiences.

Use cases include:

* Generating 3D props for interactive scenes.
* Converting reference images into usable models for game development or virtual environments.
* Experimenting with asset creation without manual modeling.

**Note**: Results may vary based on the input image quality and complexity. There are no refunds for unsatisfactory generations. Each generation costs 10 Portals credits.

### How to Use

1. **Access the Generator**: Navigate to the AI Item Generator tool within the Portals inventory.
2. **Upload an Image**: Drag and drop your image file into the designated upload area. Supported formats include PNG (recommended) and JPG.
3. **Click Generate**: Once the image is uploaded, click the "Generate" button. The process will deduct 10 Portals credits from your account. Wait for the item to finish generating.
4. **Place the item**: After generating (which may take a few minutes) you can select the object from your inventory and place it into your space.

* **Cost**: 10 Portals credits per generation. Ensure you have sufficient credits in your account before proceeding.
* **Processing Time**: Generations typically complete in 1-5 minutes, depending on server load.
* **Output**: The resulting 3D model may include textures if detectable from the input image.

### Best Practices

To achieve the best results:

* **Image Format**: Use PNG files with transparent backgrounds to isolate the item clearly.
* **Lighting**: Opt for images with neutral, even lighting to avoid shadows or highlights that could confuse the AI.
* **Item Complexity**: Focus on simple items like props (e.g., a vase, sword, or chair) or furniture. Avoid complex or multi-object scenes, as they often lead to poorer quality outputs.
* **Resolution**: Higher-resolution images (at least 512x512 pixels) tend to produce better details, but keep files under 10MB to avoid upload issues.
* **Perspective**: Front-on or slightly angled views work best; avoid extreme distortions or occlusions.

If results are suboptimal, try refining your input image according to these guidelines and regenerate.

### Troubleshooting

* **Generation Failed**: Check your internet connection and ensure the image meets the requirements. If credits were deducted without a result, contact support.
* **Poor Quality Results**: Refer to Best Practices. Common issues include backgrounds in images or overly complex subjects leading to artifacts.
* **Credits Not Deducted/Added**: Refresh your dashboard or log out/in. If issues persist, verify your account balance.
* **Slow Processing**: High demand may cause delays; try again later.

For persistent problems, provide details like the input image description and error messages when contacting support.
