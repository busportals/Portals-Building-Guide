# Variable Manager

You can manage all of your variables created with the [Update Value](../../interactive-studio/effects/update-value.md) effect in the variable manager including setting whether the value is persistent and if it is multiplayer. By default all values created are single player and non-persistent.

Persistent Values: The value will be stored across sessions (i.e. if you refresh or leave the game the value will stay the same).

Multiplayer Values: All players will share the same value.
