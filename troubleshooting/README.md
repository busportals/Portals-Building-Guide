# Troubleshooting

When something isn't working in your Portals space, this section will help you diagnose and fix the problem.

## How to Use This Section

1. **Identify the symptom** - What isn't working?
2. **Find the relevant guide** - Each page covers a specific category of issues
3. **Follow the diagnostic steps** - Work through the checklist to find the cause
4. **Apply the fix** - Each issue includes the solution

## Common Issue Categories

| Issue Type | Go To |
|------------|-------|
| Function Effect not executing | [Function Effect Errors](function-effect-errors.md) |
| Task stuck or won't change state | [Task State Issues](task-state-issues.md) |
| Iframe not loading or communicating | [Iframe Debugging](iframe-debugging.md) |
| Quick answers to frequent problems | [Common Gotchas](common-gotchas.md) |

## Before You Start

Make sure you have access to these debugging tools:

- **Task Debug Panel** - Shows real-time task states and trigger activity. Enable in Space Options > Tasks Debug.
- **Browser Console** - Press F12 to open developer tools. Check the Console tab for JavaScript errors (useful for iframes).
- **Variable Manager** - View and reset variable values in Space Options > Variable Manager.

## Still Stuck?

If you've worked through the relevant troubleshooting guide and still can't fix the issue:

1. Check the [Portals Discord](https://discord.com/invite/portals) for community help
2. Search existing discussions - your issue may have been solved before
3. Post a detailed description including:
   - What you're trying to do
   - What's happening instead
   - Steps you've already tried
